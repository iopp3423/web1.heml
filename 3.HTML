<p>The question of whether the F.A.A. has gone too far in allowing Boeing
to regulate itself has emerged as one of the key issues after the crash of
a Boeing 737 Max in Ethiopia this month, the second deadly crash of the
new plane in less than five months. The practice is already coming under scrutiny from
Congress, and lawmakers are likely to press the F.A.A.’s acting administrator on Wednesday
when he appears at a Senate hearing.</p>
